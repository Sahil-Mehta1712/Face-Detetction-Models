This project explores the performance of various face detection algorithms using a custom image dataset featuring diverse facial scenarios. The dataset includes images of:

Faces at different angles

Single and multiple faces per image

People wearing caps, glasses, and face masks

ðŸ§  Models Compared
Haar Cascade (OpenCV)

MTCNN

FaceNet MTCNN

HOG Face Detector (dlib)

Each model is evaluated based on:

Detection Accuracy (number and quality of faces detected)

Speed/Performance (inference time)

Robustness to occlusions and varying angles

The goal is to identify which face detection approach performs best across real-world variations in facial appearances and conditions.
