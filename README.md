# Face-Detetction-Models
This project compares multiple face detection models—Haar Cascade, MTCNN, FaceNet MTCNN, and HOG—on a custom dataset of facial images with varying angles, multiple people, and accessories like caps, glasses, and masks. The models are evaluated based on detection accuracy, speed, and robustness to real-world variations.
